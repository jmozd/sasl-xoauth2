# sasl-xoauth2

## Disclaimer

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Background

sasl-xoauth2 is a SASL plugin that enables client-side use of OAuth 2.0. Among
other things it enables the use of Gmail or Outlook/Office 365 SMTP relays from
Postfix.

## Building from Source

Fetch the sources, then:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Pre-Built Packages for Ubuntu

Add the [sasl-xoauth2 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~sasl-xoauth2/+archive/ubuntu/stable):

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sasl-xoauth2/stable
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Install the plugin:

```
$ sudo apt-get install sasl-xoauth2
```

## Configuration

### Configure Mail Agent

This plugin has only been tested with Postfix. First, configure Postfix to use
SASL, and specifically the XOAUTH2 method. In `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:

```
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options =
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = xoauth2
```

While you're at it, enable TLS:

```
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
```

And then set the outbound relay to Gmail's SMTP server:

```
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
```

(For Outlook, use `[smtp.office365.com]:587` instead.)

Next, add client account details to the SASL password database in
`/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`:

```
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 username@domain.com:/etc/tokens/username@domain.com
```

(For Outlook, replace `[smtp.gmail.com]:587` with `[smtp.office365.com]:587`.)

The path specified above tells sasl-xoauth2 where to find tokens for the account
"username@domain.com" (but see [A Note on chroot](#a-note-on-chroot) below).

Finally, regenerate the SASL password database:

```
$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```

#### A Note on chroot

Check if chroot is enabled:

```
$ grep -E '^(smtp|.*chroot)' /etc/postfix/master.cf
# service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command + args
smtp      inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
smtp      unix  -       -       y       -       -       smtp
```

In this example `master.cf`, chroot is in fact enabled for the Postfix smtp
process. As a result, the token path specified above will be interpreted at
runtime relative to the Postfix root (`/var/spool/postfix`, usually).

This means that **even though the path in `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` is
(and should be) `/etc/tokens/username@domain.com`**, at runtime Postfix will
attempt to read from `/var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens/username@domain.com`.

Additionally, if you see an error message similar to the following, you may need
to manually copy over root CA certificates for SSL to work within sasl-xoauth2:

```
TokenStore::Refresh: http error: error setting certificate verify locations: ...
```

To copy certificates manually, assuming the Postfix root is
`/var/spool/postfix`:

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/etc/ssl/certs
$ sudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /var/spool/postfix/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

#### A Note on postmulti

[@jamenlang](https://github.com/jamenlang) has provided a [very helpful
tutorial](https://github.com/jamenlang/sasl-xoauth2-1/wiki/Setting-up-postmulti-with-multiple-xoauth2-relays)
on setting up `postmulti` with sasl-xoauth2.

### Gmail Configuration

#### Client Credentials

Visit the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to obtain
OAuth 2 credentials (a client ID and client secret) for a "Desktop app"
application type.

Store the client ID and secret in `/etc/sasl-xoauth2.conf`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "client ID goes here",
  "client_secret": "client secret goes here"
}
```

We'll also need these credentials in the next step.

#### Initial Access Token

Use the [Gmail OAuth2 developer tools](https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools/)
to obtain an OAuth token by following the [Creating and Authorizing an OAuth
Token](https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools/wiki/OAuth2DotPyRunThrough#creating-and-authorizing-an-oauth-token)
instructions.

Save the resulting tokens in the file specified in `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`.
In our example that file will be either `/etc/tokens/username@domain.com` or
`/var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens/username@domain.com` (see [A Note on
chroot](#a-note-on-chroot)):

```json
{
  "access_token" : "access token goes here",
  "expiry" : "0",
  "refresh_token" : "refresh token goes here"
}
```

In my configuration, chroot is enabled and so even though
`/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` specifies `/etc/tokens/username@domain.com`,
my token file is `/var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens/username@domain.com`.

It may be necessary to adjust permissions on the token file so that Postfix (or,
more accurately, sasl-xoauth2 running as the Postfix user) can update it:

```
$ sudo chown -R postfix:postfix /etc/tokens
```

or:

```
$ sudo chown -R postfix:postfix /var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens
```

### Outlook/Office 365 Configuration

#### Client Credentials

There's both the internally implemented token management, as well as the
possibility to use tokens managed externally (i. e. when already having
the proper OAuth2 tokens managed by a different application work-flow).

##### Internal management of client credentials
Follow [Microsoft's instructions to register an
application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application).
Use any name you like (it doesn't have to be "sasl-xoauth2"). Under "Platform
configurations", add a native-client redirect URI for mobile/desktop
applications: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.
Then, add API permissions for `SMTP.Send`.

Store the "application (client) ID" (which you'll find in the "Overview" page
for the application you registered with Azure) in `/etc/sasl-xoauth2.conf`.
Leave `client_secret` blank. Additionally, override the token endpoint (which
points to Gmail by default):

```json
{
  "client_id": "client ID goes here",
  "client_secret": "",
  "token_endpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/oauth2/v2.0/token"
}
```

We'll also need these credentials in the next step ("Initial Access Token").

#### External token management

When running multiple applications using the same OAuth2 access (i. e. fetchmail and Postfix),
you may already have the according token management processes in place (and providing an always
current token in a user-specific file).

Under such circumstances, using another token manager may be problematic, leading to possible
token contention and other difficulties.

Assuming that the token management is already in place and provides a token file per user (and of course
maintaining that file to always contain the then valid token), you can configure sasl-xoauth2 to
simply read that user token file, without further interaction with upstream token issuers.

When doing so, you provide the token file name as the SASL password and need to set "external_token_manager" to "yes"
in sasl-xoauth's configuration file:

```json
{
  "external_token_manager": "yes"
}
```

This setting will apply to all authentications handled by this plug-in. Please also make sure that the user
under which this plug-in is run, has access to the token file's content.

#### A Note on Token Endpoints

The endpoint above
(`https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/oauth2/v2.0/token`) is suitable
for use with consumer Outlook accounts. For other types of accounts it may be
necessary to replace `consumers` with `common`, `organizations`, or a specific
tenant ID. See [Microsoft's OAuth protocol
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints)
for more on this.

#### Initial Access Token

The sasl-xoauth2
[repository](https://github.com/tarickb/sasl-xoauth2/blob/master/scripts/get-initial-outlook-tokens.py)
and pre-built packages include a script to assist in the generation of Microsoft
OAuth tokens. Run the script as follows:

```shell
$ python3 /usr/share/sasl-xoauth2/get-initial-outlook-tokens.py --client_id=CLIENT_ID_FROM_SASL_XOAUTH2_CONF PATH_TO_TOKENS_FILE
Please visit the following link in a web browser, then paste the resulting URL:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=REDACTED&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A//login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient&response_mode=query&scope=openid%20offline_access%20https%3A//outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send

Resulting URL: 
```

If using a tenant other than `consumers`, pass `--tenant=common`,
`--tenant=organizations`, or `--tenant=TENANT_ID`. The client ID will be the
same one written to `/etc/sasl-xoauth2.conf`. And `PATH_TO_TOKENS_FILE` will be
the file specified in `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`. In our example that file will
be either `/etc/tokens/username@domain.com` or
`/var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens/username@domain.com` (see [A Note on
chroot](#a-note-on-chroot)).

Visit the link in a browser and accept the various prompts. After authorizing
the application you will be redirected to a blank page. This is expected--copy
the URL of the blank page back into the terminal where you're running the
script, and the script will extract the URL components needed to obtain initial
tokens:

```
Resulting URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient?code=REDACTED
Tokens written to PATH_TO_TOKENS_FILE.
```

It may be necessary to adjust permissions on the resulting token file so that
Postfix (or, more accurately, sasl-xoauth2 running as the Postfix user) can
update it:

```
$ sudo chown -R postfix:postfix /etc/tokens
```

or:

```
$ sudo chown -R postfix:postfix /var/spool/postfix/etc/tokens
```

### Restart Postfix

```
$ service postfix restart
```

## Using Multiple Mail Providers Simultaneously

One instance of sasl-xoauth2 may provide tokens for different mail providers,
but each provider will require its own client ID, client secret, and token
endpoint. In this case, each of these may be set in the token file rather than
in `/etc/sasl-xoauth2.conf`. Set them when setting the initial access token:

```json
{
  "access_token" : "access token goes here",
  "client_id": "client ID goes here",
  "client_secret": "client secret goes here, if required",
  "token_endpoint": "token endpoint goes here, for non-Gmail",
  "expiry" : "0",
  "refresh_token" : "refresh token goes here"
}
```

## Debugging

By default, sasl-xoauth2 will write to syslog if authentication fails. To
disable this, set `log_to_syslog_on_failure` to `no` in
`/etc/sasl-xoauth2.conf`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "client ID goes here",
  "client_secret": "client secret goes here",
  "log_to_syslog_on_failure": "no"
}
```

Conversely, to get more verbose logging when authentication fails, set
`log_full_trace_on_failure` to `yes`.

If Postfix complains about not finding a SASL mechanism (along the lines of
`warning: SASL authentication failure: No worthy mechs found`), it's possible
that either `make install` or the pre-built package put libsasl-xoauth2.so in
the wrong directory.
